ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm currently transitioning from a healthcare career into IT. I'm a Cyber student with a strong passion for technology and a dedication to solving complex problems through hands-on learning and continuous growth.


## Objective

Iâ€™m building real-world cybersecurity labs that showcase my readiness for Identity & Access Management (IAM) and Tier 1 security roles. My projects focus on enterprise-grade access control, Azure AD role-based permissions, group policy enforcement, and user lifecycle operations. I also demonstrate foundational blue team skills with tools like Splunk, Windows Event Viewer, and PowerShell. Every repo is proof-of-work: designed to highlight my ability to secure, audit, and troubleshoot identity systems in a live environment.
